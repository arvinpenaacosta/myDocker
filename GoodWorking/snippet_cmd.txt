COMMAND SNIPPET
---------------------------
# Basic Usage If you have a docker-compose.yml file named docker-compose.prod.yml and you want to use it
docker-compose -f <docker-compose yml file> up
docker-compose -f docker-compose2.yml up

# Build and Start the Containers:
docker-compose up --build

# Run in Detached Mode (Optional): If you want to run the containers in the background, use the -d flag:
docker-compose up -d --build

# Stop the Containers: To stop the running containers,
docker-compose down

# Check Container Status: You can view the running containers using
docker ps

# Stop a Specific Container:
docker stop fastapi_container
docker-compose stop mssql_db

# To restart a service that was stopped, use:
docker-compose start frontend
docker-compose start mssql_db
